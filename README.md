# aeon-whitepaper
This is the proposed AEON community whitepaper.

The paper is written using LaTeX. 
The files are organized with a "main" file called aeon-whitepaper.tex, which is the one that should be compiled via TeXstudio or similar. Each main section is in a separate file within the "sections" subfolder.  All images are in the "images" subfolder.

When committing changes to a branch, the corresponding rendered aeon-whitepaper.pdf should also be committed.
