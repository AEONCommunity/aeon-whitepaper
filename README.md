# aeon-whitepaper
This is the proposed AEON community whitepaper.

Look at **aeon-whitepaper.pdf** in the Master branch to see the latest draft version.

Note, that this paper still has sections being worked on, as well as general formatting in progress.
Feel free to suggest any changes, or make a pull request.

The paper is written using LaTeX. 
The files are organized with a "main" file called aeon-whitepaper.tex, which is the one that should be compiled via TeXstudio or similar. Each main section is in a separate file within the "sections" subfolder.  All images are in the "images" subfolder.

When making a pull request, the corresponding rendered aeon-whitepaper.pdf should also be included if possible.
